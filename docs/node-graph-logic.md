## Nodes Logic

The evaluation of nodes follows a **left-to-right** process. For nodes with multiple entries, the first entries represent the inputs, which are positioned at the top-left side of the node.

In the context of a graph with multiple nodes, each node with multiple inputs is evaluated sequentially. The node positioned at the top-left is evaluated first, followed by the node directly beneath it, continuing until all nodes have been evaluated.

### How to Evaluate a Node?

Evaluating a node is simple:
1. **Click** on the node.
2. The parameters of the node will be displayed.
3. The **Stream Attributes List Window** will update to show the relevant data associated with that node.

Each node has a specific purpose, and when combined with other nodes, they can form complex systems to perform more advanced operations.

By following this logical evaluation process, you can build intricate and dynamic systems by simply combining different nodes and their respective functions.
